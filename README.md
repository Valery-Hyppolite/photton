A simple javascript website that fetches data from a remote database to render out photos. This website provides user the ability to search photos, and download them as need.

This apllication was deployed with AWS s3, CloudFront, and Route53. Created a CI/CD pipeline with github and AWS codebuild to re-deploy the app automatically anytime changes are pushed to the git repository.
