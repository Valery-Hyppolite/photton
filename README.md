A dynamic JavaScript website that harnesses the power of remote database connectivity to showcase an array of captivating photos. With seamless data fetching capabilities, users can easily search for specific photos and download them as desired, enhancing their browsing experience.

Leveraging the robust services of AWS, including S3, CloudFront, and Route53, we have deployed this application to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and secure content delivery. For continous deployment, created a CI/CD pipeline, integrating GitHub with AWS CodeBuild, enabling automatic redeployment of the application whenever changes are pushed to the git repository.
